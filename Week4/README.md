  * Learned to build scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, heatmaps
  * Used **categorical and distribution plots** for data insight extraction

* **📦 Data Handling with Pandas**

  * Notebook: `Pandas For Data Exploration.ipynb`
  * Cleaned and explored structured data using `head()`, `info()`, filtering, and grouping

* **🧮 NumPy Basics and Exercises**

  * Notebook: `03_Numpy_Exercise[1].ipynb`
  * Array creation, reshaping, broadcasting, indexing

* **📁 Real Dataset Projects**

  * **Project 1: E-Commerce Analysis**

    * Files: `Ecommerce Purchases.csv`, `Ecommerce_Purchases_Exercise.ipynb`
    * Performed customer insights, email domain analysis, and purchase behavior stats
  * **Project 2: SF Salaries Analysis**

    * File: `SF_Salaries_Project1.ipynb`
    * Analyzed government salary data with filtering, aggregation, and visualization

* **📂 Mini-Tasks & Labs**

  * `task1.ipynb`, `TASK2.ipynb`, `examal.ipynb`, `cv.ipynb`
